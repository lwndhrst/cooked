# BDO Cooking Material Calculator

Completely wrong and useless because:

1. I have no clue about actual proc rates
2. Even if i knew I'd be way too lazy to implement them properly
3. Only 'Valencia Meal' and related recipes are implemented at this time
4. Fuck material substitution

## Installation (just don't, really)

```
cargo install --git https://github.com/lwndhrst/cooked.git
```

## Usage (no, please...)

```
cooked --help
```
```
cooked valencia-meal -n 1000
```

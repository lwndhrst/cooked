# BDO Cooking Material Calculator

Completely wrong and useless because:

1. I have no clue about actual proc rates
2. Even if i knew I'd be way too lazy to implement them properly
3. Only 'Valencia Meal' and related recipes are implemented at this time
4. Fuck material substitution

## Usage

```
cooked -n 1000 valencia-meal
```
